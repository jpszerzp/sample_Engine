# sample_Engine

This is repo of some sample code of my personal game engine project. The repo starts with components from collision systems, and is subject to more released code as project grows. My recent focus is to realize an industrial physics engine component for this engine, and recent future updates will mainly be about physics components.

## Brief Doc
### BoxCollider.cs
Box collider implementing Collider interface. Simulate behaviors of box-shape colliders in physics environment.

### SphericalCollider.cs
Sphere collider implementing Collider interface. Simulate behaviors of spherical colliders in physics environment.

### PlaneCollider.cs
Plane collider implementing Collider interface. Simulate behaviors of plane colliders in physics environment. TODO: for now there is a "thickness" built into this collider.
